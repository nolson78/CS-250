1.  **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?**
I interpret user needs by listening to feedback, identifying goals, and translating them into clear user stories. User stories keep development focused on what the user truly values and help ensure each feature serves a real purpose.
2.  **How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
I approach development as an iterative process that improves through feedback and collaboration. I plan to use Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to stay adaptable and deliver value in small, consistent increments.
3. ** What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
A good team member communicates openly, supports others, and focuses on shared goals. Collaboration, accountability, and flexibility are key to building strong, productive Agile teams.
